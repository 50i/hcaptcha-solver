# hcaptcha-solver
unlike every other kid over here who claims to drop hcaptcha solver in github but ends up sharing a code with library of paid solver. I am bringing a free hcaptcha solver. which will get the token or capkey (through python requests) without the need to open a browser and solve the captcha. 

> I modifed a couple of github codes. The fastest one i could come across was by this guy=  https://github.com/QIN2DIM/hcaptcha-challenger 

> His models dont have enough images, But still it works alot better than others. 

> Soon ! Today or tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow, i will be sharing with y'all the source code. 

> Solves captcha in 10 Seconds.

### Reason why i started working on this project ?
> I used many paid api's capmonster, anti-captcha, bought from github users, All of them had solving time of 15 to 30 seconds. Every one claims we are coming with a v2 update, then scams you!. Some sell outdated codes, and if you ask why it takes time. They ask you to Buy HQ proxies from them. 

# All you need to do is wait and put a star on my repository.
